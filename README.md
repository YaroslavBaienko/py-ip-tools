# Python Network Utility Tools

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to assist network engineers, administrators, and students in various network-related tasks. These scripts simplify complex network calculations, automate subnet division, and provide valuable insights into IP address management and network architecture. This toolkit is ideal for network planning, optimization, and educational purposes.

## Features
- **Subnet Calculation**: Automates the process of dividing a network into a specified number of subnets.
- **Subnet Allocation Based on Host Requirements**: Determines the number of subnets and their sizes based on the required number of hosts per subnet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Knowledge of IP addressing and subnetting

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-network-utility-tools.git
cd python-network-utility-tools
```

### Usage
Import the required functions in your Python script or interactive environment.

Example:
```python
from network_utils import calculate_subnets, calculate_subnets_by_hosts

# Calculate subnets
subnets = calculate_subnets("192.168.1.0/24", 4)
for subnet in subnets:
    print(subnet)

# Calculate subnets based on the number of hosts
subnet_info = calculate_subnets_by_hosts("192.168.1.0/24", 50)
print(subnet_info)
```
